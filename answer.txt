What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

The difference between a merge and a rebase has to do with how the changes from one branch are copied to another branch. A merge keeps the original contents of both branches with additional merge commits in the branch being copied to. A rebase rewrites the history of the branch being copied to to start at the last commit of the branch being copied from, therefore creating a more clean commit history while sacrificing some safety by rewriting project history.
